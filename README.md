Hey!
This is a tool which creates Datapacks to allow you to choose the biomes you want to play. 
After running biome_selector_main.py, just take your datapack into the datapack folder of your world. Then click 
"World Type" until you see "Default" again. If you don't do this, it WONT WORK!
Please report bugs!

TL;DR: run biome_selecor_main.py; click "World Type" until you see "Default" again.
For me Pillow is only working with Python 3.10.6, so make sure you use this.

Requirements: Python 3.10.6 (with PATH enabled) and internet connection while opening the for the first time to download Pillow (Python libary)

Tips:
-use river biomes for nicer rivers
-adjust water level manually
-use some ocean biomes
